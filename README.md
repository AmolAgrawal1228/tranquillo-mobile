**Hello everyone**! This is a readme file to make sure that the code that is pushed to the master is good!

1. Make sure that code is **working** (no errors, warnings, or console.logs)
2. **Clean your code** (No big blocks of comments, no single line comments, no files that are not being used)

If the code does not satisfy any of these requirements, the commit will be **rejected and reverted** and you may lose your code. So, make sure that good code is committed to  master, and the code that you are working on is committed to your branch.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN BRANCH (commands in order)

1. `git status`
2. `git branch` (Make sure that you are in the master branch. It should have a star and be green)
3. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (This creates the branch)
4. Now, you have switched to the branch. You may make edits and once you feel like pushing, do the following commands
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m <commit-message>`
7. `git push origin <branch-name>`

Thank you!
